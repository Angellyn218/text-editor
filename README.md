# Text Editor

## Description

This text editor is a simple single page that adds natural code styling. In addition, it provides a lot of offline functionality through PWA, indexedDB, and local storage. 

I created this project to practice the PWA skills that I learned in class. All of the data is stored in IndexedDB API so that it can be stored and retrived.
